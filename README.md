# LAS Viewer - North Carolina Geological Survey
Log Ascii Standard (LAS) is the primary file storage format for geophysical data gleaned from exploratory and observation wells, be it from oil or natural gas wells from the petroleum industry or water monitoring wells from the environmental industry. Researchers use the information stored in LAS files to visualize the numerical data stored in the files which are converted to digital geophysical lines (curves) and viewed on a monitor. Easy curve comparison and contrasting from visualization is crucial for use as a subsurface geological investigation tool. In order to convert curves from numerical data, typically a specialized software package is required. These software packages can be cost prohibitive to the independent or student researcher. This LAS Viewer is an alternative to cost-prohibitive specialized software packages.
